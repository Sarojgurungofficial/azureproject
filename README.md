# azureproject

This project is simplified view of creating end-to-end data engineering project. This means from creating the resources in Microsoft Azure i.e., creating Azure Data Factory (ADF), creating storage account, to choosing the configuration location , creating logic app and setting up cloud based SQL server.
Here, I have created ingestion pipeline and increamental loop in Azure Data Factory, which basically handles the data load dynamically and also handles the incremental data.
Furthermore, I have used github for version control and for Ci/Cd deplymwnts.
